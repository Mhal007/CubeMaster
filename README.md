# CubeMaster

Rubik's cube training site.

- OLL and PLL algorithms practice 
- OLL and PLL attack modes
- 3x3x3 Timer

## TODO
#### Priority level 1
- block space scrolling
- menu with buttons for: accept, +2, random new, delete
- filtering algs by group
- add router and paths
- remove reducible moves from scrambles
- save settings to local storage: grouping level, solution visiblity, algs selection
- organize imports + absolute paths instead of relative
- PropTypes all the way
- fix: rerandomize alg after diabling it in the options
- fix: space should rerandomize when no algs selected


#### Priority level 2
- visual scramble !
- add account support
- create custom images for algs (better res as well)
- Refactor algs naming and order
- refactor timer & nr of renders
- isTraining refactor (the 'real' flag)
- refactoring of isAlgorithmActive (DB -> local storage)
- sets of algs kept in DB to load selection?
- results result format (ms / s / m / h)


#### Priority level 3
- Blindfolded + 1/2 + scrambler
- DNF option
- 3x3x3 working + scrambler
- mobile view
- new averages
- +x/-x to average (green/red)
- responsive view (UWHD)
